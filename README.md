## CONTENT OF THIS REPOSITORY

This repository contains the exercises I did following along an online course to learn JavaScript. 
The course is The Odin Project > <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foundations Course</a>.

This is the list of the folders:

- the "node" folder stores an app.js file I wrote and executed to understand the basic functioning of a server. 

- The "replit" folder contains all the exercises I made on the "Replit" website, which offers exercises about JavaScript. For this website see -> https://replit.com/.

- The "theOdinProject" folder contains all exercises I made following the "Foundations Course" on "The Odin Project" website, as mentioned above.

## USAGE
I kept those files as a reference for the basic JavaScript syntax, if you find them useful, clone the repository to keep everything with you. Also check the "keyQuestions.md" to find key questions about the topics
